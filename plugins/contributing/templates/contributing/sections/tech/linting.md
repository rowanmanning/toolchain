### Linting

The code quality of this project is checked automatically, with tooling configured in the way I normally write JavaScript. Please keep to the existing style.

Linting errors will fail the build on any PRs, you can also run linting manually as part of the following command:

```
npx @rmtc/toolchain verify
```
