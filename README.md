# RMTC (Rowan Manning's Tool Chain)

This is a suite of build tools for Node.js projects, really intended to be used for my projects â€“ I make no promises about supporting your use case.

This project was inspired by [FT.com Tool Kit](https://github.com/financial-Times/dotcom-tool-kit), a project we use to build Node.js projects at the Financial Times.

> [!CAUTION]<br/>
> This project is in early alpha, it's highly likely that we'll introduce accidental breaking changes.
